      <h2>About Dr. Heffeweisen</h2>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg" alt="Kimmy and Dr. Heffeweisen Collaborating">
      <p>Dr. Philip Heffeweisen, PhD, is a globally misunderstood pioneer in the theoretical field of hydrogen oxygenation risk studies. A graduate of the prestigious (and now defunct) Alpine Correspondence Institute of Advanced Uncertainty, Dr. Heffeweisen has committed the better part of two decades to researching the biochemical and existential dangers of oxygenating hydrogen. His lab, once a converted garage, now operates out of a slightly larger converted garage featuring a window-mounted air conditioning unit and state-of-the-art IKEA storage.</p>
      <p>He is aided by his trusted research fellow, Kimmy Salmeron, who has bravely endured years of unregulated experiments and academic ridicule to co-author a surprisingly large number of publications, all of which prominently feature words like "quantum", "synergy", and "gastric implosion." Together, they fight to bring awareness to a danger the scientific community continues to ignore—mainly because it sounds completely made up.</p>

      <h2>Why Oxygenating Hydrogen is a Terrible Idea</h2>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9nRZKXy.jpg" alt="Dangerous Reactions Chart">
      <p>While mainstream science continues to pursue reckless advancements like sustainable energy and space colonization, Dr. Heffeweisen has bravely sounded the alarm on what may be humanity's greatest overlooked threat: the oxygenation of hydrogen. At first glance, this may sound like basic chemistry—after all, it's how water is made. But as Dr. Heffeweisen warns, in very specific and poorly defined conditions, this combination can wreak havoc on the human body in ways that are both deeply concerning and mildly comedic.</p>
      <p>Through extensive experimentation (and several unfortunate incidents involving soda canisters, electrolysis rigs, and one very startled cat), Dr. Heffeweisen has identified a host of troubling physiological effects from direct or indirect exposure to oxygenated hydrogen, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accelerated eyebrow growth</li>
        <li>Sudden and irreversible craving for pickles</li>
        <li>Uncontrolled winking at inappropriate times</li>
        <li>Perceived enhancement of musical ability (not supported by evidence)</li>
        <li>Flatulent harmonics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most disturbingly, test subjects reported a drastic decline in their ability to resist puns, particularly those involving chemistry. This condition—referred to by Dr. Heffeweisen as "punogenic stress disorder"—has no known cure except beer.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AQwNEdx.jpg" alt="Beer – The Antidote">
      <p>Beer, as it turns out, contains no oxygenated hydrogen in its active ingredients (aside from the water, which is conveniently ignored in this model). Instead, beer offers a time-tested blend of fermented grains, social lubricant, and temporary euphoria. In short, where oxygenated hydrogen fails, beer refreshes.</p>
